    If you're new to Python, you might want to start by getting an idea of what
    the language is like. Scikit-criteria is 100% Python, so if you've got minimal
    comfort with Python you'll probably get a lot more out of our project.

    If you're new to programming entirely, you might want to start with this
    `list of Python resources for non-programmers <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers>`_

    If you already know a few other languages and want to get up to speed with
    Python quickly, we recommend `Dive Into Python <http://www.diveintopython3.net/>`_. If that's not quite your
    style, there are many other `books about Python <https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBooks>`_.

    At last if you already know Python but check the `Scipy Lecture Notes <http://www.scipy-lectures.org/>`_
