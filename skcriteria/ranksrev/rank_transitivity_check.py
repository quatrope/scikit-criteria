"""
Transitivity Checker for MCDM Robustness Evaluation.

This module evaluates the logical consistency and stability of Multi-Criteria
Decision Making (MCDM) methods through transitivity analysis. It decomposes
decision problems into pairwise comparisons and reconstructs global rankings
to assess method robustness.

The module validates whether rankings satisfy the transitivity property
(if A ≻ B and B ≻ C, then A ≻ C) and provides mechanisms to handle violations.

Key Features
------------
- Transitivity validation through pairwise decomposition
- Ranking recomposition with cycle-breaking strategies
- Comprehensive diagnostic reporting

def _transitivity_break_bound(n):
    """
    Calculate the maximum number of transitivity violations possible in a \
        n-tournament.

    This function computes the theoretical upper bound for the number of
    3-cycles (intransitive triples) that can occur in a tournament with n
    alternatives. A 3-cycle occurs when alternative A beats B, B beats C, but
    C beats A, violating transitivity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of alternatives/participants in the tournament.
        Must be a positive integer >= 3 for meaningful results.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        Maximum possible number of transitivity violations (3-cycles) in a
        tournament of size n. Returns 0 for n < 3.

    Notes
    -----
    This bound represents the worst-case scenario for transitivity violations.

def _in_degree_sort(dag):
    """
    Sort nodes of a DAG into hierarchical groups based on in-degree levels.

    This function performs a topological layering of a directed acyclic graph
    by grouping nodes according to their in-degree in the graph's transitive
    reduction. Nodes with the same in-degree level represent alternatives
    at the same hierarchical level in the preference structure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dag : networkx.DiGraph
        A directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing preference relationships
        between alternatives.

    Returns
    -------
    list of list
        A list where each element is a list of nodes at the same hierarchical
        level. The first sublist contains nodes with in-degree 0 (top level),
        the second contains nodes with in-degree 1 after removing the first
        level, and so on.

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm works iteratively:

    1. Compute the transitive reduction of the input DAG to remove redundant
        edges
    2. Find all nodes with in-degree 0 (no incoming edges) - these form the
        top level
    3. Remove these nodes from the graph
    4. Repeat until all nodes are processed

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx

    >>> # Create a simple DAG
    >>> dag = nx.DiGraph([('A', 'C'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'D')])

def _assign_rankings(groups):
    """
    Assign ascending integer rankings to grouped items.

    This function converts hierarchical groups of items into a ranking
    dictionary where all items in the same group receive the same rank.
    Rankings start from 1 for the first group and increment by 1 for
    each subsequent group.

    Parameters
    ----------
    groups : list of list
        A list of groups where each group is a list of items that should
        receive the same ranking. Groups are processed in order, with
        earlier groups receiving better (lower) ranks.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary mapping each item to its assigned integer rank.
        Items in the first group get rank 1, items in the second group
        get rank 2, and so on.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is typically used after hierarchical sorting (like
    `_in_degree_sort`) to convert topological levels into numerical
    rankings. The ranking scheme assigns:

    - Rank 1: Best performing items (first group)
    - Rank 2: Second best items (second group)
    - And so on...

    All items within the same group are considered tied and receive
    identical ranks. This preserves the hierarchical structure while
    providing a simple numerical ranking.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> groups = [['A', 'B'], ['C'], ['D', 'E']]
    >>> rankings = _assign_rankings(groups)

def _format_transitivity_cycles(cycles):
    """
    Format transitivity violation cycles for human-readable display.

    This function converts a list of cycles (representing transitivity
    violations) into a standardized string format that clearly shows
    the circular preference relationships. Each cycle is formatted to
    show the complete circular dependency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cycles : list of list
        A list where each element is a list representing a cycle of
        alternatives that violate transitivity.

    Returns
    -------
    list of list
        A list where each element is a list containing a single formatted
        string representing the cycle in "A>B>C>A" format, clearly showing
        the circular preference relationship.

    Notes
    -----
    The formatting transforms cycles like ['A', 'B', 'C'] into strings
    like "A>B>C>A" to make transitivity violations more readable. The
    ">" symbol represents "is preferred to" or "dominates".

    A transitivity violation occurs when we have a cycle like:
    - A is preferred to B
    - B is preferred to C
    - C is preferred to A

    This creates a logical inconsistency that violates the transitivity
    property of rational preferences.

    Each formatted cycle is wrapped in a list to maintain consistency
    with other formatting functions and to allow for potential future
    extensions that might include additional metadata per cycle.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> cycles = [['A', 'B', 'C'], ['X', 'Y', 'Z', 'W']]
    >>> formatted = _format_transitivity_cycles(cycles)

class RankTransitivityChecker(SKCMethodABC):
    """
    Robustness evaluator for Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods.

    This class validates the logical consistency and stability of MCDM method
    rankings by analyzing transitivity properties through pairwise alternative
    comparisons.
    It identifies ranking inconsistencies and provides alternative ranking
    reconstructions when transitivity violations occur.

    The evaluation process is the following:

    1. **Pairwise Dominance Analysis**:
       Evaluates all possible pairs of alternatives using the provided MCDM
       method to construct a directed dominance graph representing preference
       relationships.

    2. **Transitivity Validation** (Test Criterion 2):
       Detects cycles in the dominance graph that violate the transitivity
       property. A transitive ranking requires that if A > B and B > C, then
       A > C must hold.

    3. **Ranking Stability Assessment** (Test Criterion 3):
       Compares the original ranking with reconstructed rankings to evaluate
       consistency when the decision problem is decomposed and recomposed.

    4. **Ranking Reconstruction**:
       When transitivity violations exist, applies cycle-breaking strategies to
       generate alternative valid rankings through graph decomposition
       techniques.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dmaker : object
        Decision maker instance that must implement an ``evaluate(dm)`` method.
        This represents the MCDM method or pipeline to be evaluated for
        robustness.

    random_state : int, numpy.random.Generator, or None, default=None
        Controls randomization in cycle-breaking strategies and alternative
        ranking generation. Ensures reproducible results when set to a
        specific integer.

    allow_missing_alternatives : bool, default=False
        Whether to allow rankings that don't include all original alternatives
        (using a pipeline that implements a filter, for example can remove
        alternatives).
        When False, raises ValueError if any alternative is missing from
        results. When True, missing alternatives are assigned the worst
        ranking + 1.

    make_transitive_strategy : str or callable, default="random"
        Strategy for breaking cycles in non-transitive dominance graphs.
        Available built-in strategies include cycle removal heuristics.
        Can also accept custom callable functions for specialized approaches.

    max_ranks : int, default=50
        Maximum number of alternative rankings to generate when breaking
        cycles. Controls computational complexity by limiting the number of
        decompositions.

    parallel_backend : str or None, default=None
        Backend for parallel computation of pairwise evaluations.
        Options include 'threading', 'multiprocessing', or None for sequential.
        Improves performance for large numbers of alternatives.

    n_jobs : int or None, default=None
        Number of parallel jobs for pairwise evaluation. When None, uses all
        available processors. Set to 1 for sequential processing.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If ``dmaker`` doesn't implement the required ``evaluate()`` method.

    ValueError
        If ``make_transitive_strategy`` is not a valid strategy name or \
            callable.
        If ``allow_missing_alternatives=False`` and alternatives are missing \
            from results.

    Examples
    --------
    Basic usage with an MCDM method:

    >>> from skcriteria.preprocessing import invert_objectives
    >>> from skcriteria.madm import simple
    >>>
    >>> # Create a decision maker
    >>> dm_method = simple.WeightedSum()
    >>>
    >>> # Initialize transitivity checker
    >>> checker = RankTransitivityChecker(dm_method)
    >>>
    >>> # Evaluate a decision matrix
    >>> result = checker.evaluate(dm=decision_matrix)
    >>>
    >>> # Check test results
    >>> print(f"Test Criterion 2: {result.extra['test_criterion_2']}")
