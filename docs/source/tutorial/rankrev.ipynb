    "# Rank reversals\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides an overview of the use of the scikit-criteria ranking comparison tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-criteria decision methods may present irregularities in their rankings that compromise the reliability of their results.\n",
    "Depending on how the alternatives are defined and evaluated in a problem, rank reversals are classified in five types.\n",
    "To evaluate the robustness of these methods, :cite:p:`wang2006ranking` proposed three test criteria that cover all five kinds of rank reversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rank invariance**: The rank of an optimal alternative must remain invariant when a sub-optimal alternative is worsened.\n",
    "2. **Transitivity**: when a decision problem is partitioned in smaller sub-problems, the relative transitivity of alternatives must be retained.\n",
    "2. **Recomposition consistency**: a new ranking constructed from a set of smaller sub-problems must be equivalent to the ranking obtained from running the original method."

    "In scikit-criteria we implement these checks via the classes `RankInvariantChecker` and `TransitivityChecker`, which are available in the `skcriteria.ranksrev` module.\n",

    "\n",
    "Test criterion 1 evaluates the stability of an MCDM method's top-ranked alternative under minor degradations of non-optimal alternatives, which roughly attempts to detect rank reversals due to irrelevant changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its most basic form, the `RankInvariantChecker` works by worsening each sub-optimal alternative by a chosen amount `repeat` times, and stores every result in a `RanksComparator`."

    "The former ensures that transitivity holds across pairwise comparisons, that is, if alternative $A_1 \\succ A_2$, and $A_2 \\succ A_3$, then $A_1 \\succ A_3$; and the latter builds up a total ordering out of these relationships to recompose them into a complete global ranking to test against the original ranking.\n",
