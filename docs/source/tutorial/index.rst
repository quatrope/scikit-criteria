Scientific articles
-------------------


Scientific articles or paper is an academic work that is usually published in
an academic journal. It contains original research results or reviews existing
results. Such a paper, also called an article, will only be considered valid if
it undergoes a process of peer review by one or more referees who check that
the content of the paper is suitable for publication in the journal :cite:p:`enwiki:1134614840`.

Several bibliographic databases organize digital collections of references to
published literature, including journal and newspaper articles and conference
proceedings. The following links contain publications that cite the
Scikit-Criteria paper :cite:p:`scikit-criteria`, and present novel applications of multi-criteria models
to different scientific areas.

    If you're new to Python, you might want to start by getting an idea of what
    the language is like. Scikit-criteria is 100% Python, so if you've got minimal
    comfort with Python you'll probably get a lot more out of our project.

    If you're new to programming entirely, you might want to start with this
    `list of Python resources for non-programmers <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers>`_

    If you already know a few other languages and want to get up to speed with
    Python quickly, we recommend `Dive Into Python <http://www.diveintopython3.net/>`_. If that's not quite your
    style, there are many other `books about Python <https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBooks>`_.

    At last, if you're already familiar with Python and eager to explore the scientific stack further, be sure to check out 
    the `Scipy Lecture Notes <http://www.scipy-lectures.org/>`_
